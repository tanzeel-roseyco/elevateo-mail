# Product requirements and decision record

### Mira BE03 UI isolated R24 implementation (2026-10-14)

Root authorizes isolated BE03 implementation over `03ae770` while BE02 remains OPEN/unaccepted and integration/release gated. Mira owns the send gateway, generated web artifacts after canonical contract, and review/approval/status UI. The S1/S2 UI renders full saved plaintext content, explicit correspondence approval, original-binding uncertain retry, and server-owned simulated status. Runtime, independent review and actual visual validation are pending; no completion or delivery claim. Canonical source is `contracts/v1/openapi.json`. See [Mira scoped evidence](docs/completion/be03-mira-r24.md).


## Current execution status

Application IN PROGRESS — R24 isolated BE03 implementation (2026-10-14). Root explicitly authorizes implementation on baseline `03ae770c56271cd8236726bfd8fe63248e81283d` in parallel with BE02 acceptance; BE02 stays OPEN/unaccepted and integration/release remain gated. Priority is S1+S2: saved draft -> consistent review -> human approval -> durable queued intent. Canonical additive contract is `contracts/v1/openapi.json`, version `1.0.0-send.1`; existing C/D operations/components and fixtures are frozen. Contract source, preservation manifest and synthetic regression fixtures are prepared; Docker generation, conformance and integrated runtime are NOT_RUN. See [R24 record](docs/completion/be03-r24-contract-integration.md). Requested Fast billing is unverified. Historical R23 checkpoint follows; its BE03-closed sequencing is superseded only for this isolated authorized lane.

Application IN PROGRESS — R23 documentation checkpoint (2026-10-14). BE02 OPEN/unaccepted; BE03 CLOSED until root accepts BE02. Application completion has priority; R&D remains separate. Invitation source is exact 51ca5d2eadd74b7ac4c1a2f5f82cd49323b15dc5; core/empty/revoked/logout evidence belongs to exact 86036e276df9c3294206e6bfa14d478c223c54dd. Observer remains OFF. Production, contracts, observer boundary and four Docker recipes are unchanged.

R19 core login/read/persisted-draft/search PASS stands with restoration, authenticated HTTP, worker drain and cleanup. Its sixteen screenshots do not establish complete visual acceptance: search was loading; settled-search evidence remains in R12. R12's 21 PNGs and R18 conflict/revocation PASS stand. R18 logout FAILED, cause UNKNOWN; F2 memory-only recovery limitation remains OPEN.

R21d build/TypeScript compile/privacy regression PASS. First empty visual partition failed setup with MODULE_NOT_FOUND ./quiet-reporter.ts: zero cases/zero PNGs; seven partitions not admitted. R21e CLI reporter override was insufficient because config resolves its reporter first: zero cases/zero PNGs, seven not admitted. Exact cleanup/independent absence PASS, lease FREE. R21f private active-config .ts-to-.js correction before tsc is pending review/runtime; no PASS is claimed. Source review does not establish runtime sufficiency.

Remaining: eight empty/revoked UI partitions and root manual visual acceptance; R22 invitation affected unit/lint/type checks, frozen genuine SCN-AUTH-006-P and separate supplemental keyboard/visual evidence on exact51ca; corrected logout on exact86036. Root owns acceptance and actual vault; Jules supervises Soren fleet runtime; Cassian OFF401 / INT-403 owns this documentation integration. No new research gate or repeat of passed unchanged suites is implied.

Project obsidian.md and the remote pending record are NOT synchronized to the actual vault. Actual Obsidian remains 134117 bytes, SHA256 de210bf0205ae28125d2c6125ff18fdbac87f947b6e2f92fff89b4b09e54b372, unchanged because C: is full. Automatic approval review rejected deleting a verified duplicate as “blocked by policy”, with no detailed reason; no deletion or retry. Requested LOW/Fast is not verified effective billing. See the R23 journal for receipt hashes, process history and BE03 readiness; R18 seal and failed histories remain linked.

Evidence: [R23 journal](docs/completion/int403-r23-application-state.md), [R18 seal](docs/completion/int401-r18-handoff.md), [history](docs/completion/int401-status-history-20261014.md).

Design date: 2026-10-11; expanded planning revision: 2026-10-12. Current scoped decisions override older planning assumptions; consent-based sending remains required.

| R14 | C# Windows GUI, Java Android APK, SwiftUI iOS and suitable desktop/mobile alternatives | Separate platform artifacts and target-runtime evidence; Qt/Ionic/Electron assessed as alternatives |
| R15 | Distinct in-app Codex and Claude/Fable CLI connectors | Supported authentication/protocols, fixed-executable adapters, stream/cancel/approval tests and enforced tool/data scopes |
| R16 | Opus 5.5 owns all C++ and motion design; use Anime.js for web polish | Actual assignment identity, accessible reduced-motion behavior and measured browser/native evidence |
| R17 | Nine addresses across one or two domains; user Resend CLI; future computer-use connection to Instantly; no live sends | Inventory distinguishes aliases; read-only CLI discovery; separate account-connection and warmup gates; warmup stays disabled until no-live-send constraint explicitly changes |

The current source-intake request explicitly authorizes collecting all six codebases in this repository. See [source inventory](third_party/README.md), [independent dossiers](docs/reference-repositories/README.md) and [goals](docs/goals-and-traceability.md). Archival source import is complete; integrated application source now exists, with runtime acceptance pending as recorded above.

## Product boundary

The first release is a company mailroom: named addresses, shared conversations, assignment, team status, per-user read state, composer, drafts, search, attachments and audit history. Individual mailbox permissions allow private addresses where required. Ten users do not imply ten paid email accounts or ten servers; people, addresses, mailboxes and provider identities are separate concepts.

Company correspondence must meet the provider's rules. Marketing sequences are a later, explicitly scoped module with consent evidence, unsubscribe and dispatch-time suppression. The original ambition to resemble Instantly/Smartlead informs workflow quality; Resend is not an approved transport for unsolicited cold outreach. See the [current provider constraints](docs/mail-delivery-and-hosting.md).

This is an API-based mailbox product. Full Gmail/Outlook history synchronization, conventional IMAP access from Apple Mail, calendars, contacts synchronization and federation are not implied by the first release. Add Gmail/Graph adapters later if existing account history becomes a requirement. Do not move existing company MX records to Resend until that migration is separately designed and tested.

## Decision status

| Decision | State | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resend + self-hosted Supabase | User selected | Explicit current instruction |
| Company mailbox + web + Mac + Windows + AI connectors | User requested | Current product direction |
| Rails API/worker; React/TypeScript; Rust/Tauri Mac; C# Windows | Accepted local direction under ADR 0002; per-task gates remain | One domain authority and versioned cross-language contracts; inspect existing first-party work first |
| PostgreSQL job queue, separate API and worker | Working defaults for scoped local completion | One durable source of truth; API restarts must not lose jobs |
| VPS, Docker Compose, reverse proxy, off-host backups | Recommended, approval pending | Small fixed team; operational ownership must be deliberate |
| Resend stable send/receive APIs, not private-beta Inboxes | Recommended | Avoid availability and response-shape dependency on limited beta |
| MCP read/search/draft first; human-controlled sending | Recommended | Enforce permissions and prevent email content from granting actions |
| Best-of reuse by selective adaptation | Recommended | Audited foundations need reliability/security fixes; no blind merge |
| Engineering standards | Local engineering baseline; production decisions open | 2026-10-12 local-completion instruction supersedes the blanket wait within that scope; no blanket approval claimed |
| Expanded orchestration/language/client plans | Requested workflow documented; implementation pending | Follow .planning/README.md and ADR 0002; initial exact-model opinions and synthesis completed; BE-01 partial draft #5 unaccepted; FE-01 read checkpoint synthesis accepted |

## Proposed permissions

Organization roles: owner, administrator, member. Mailbox roles: viewer, contributor, sender. A membership in the organization does not automatically disclose every mailbox. Administrator can manage access, but reading content requires mailbox membership; access changes are audited. Emergency access must be explicit, temporary and visible.

Viewers can read approved content; contributors can draft, assign and label; senders can finalize a reviewed draft for dispatch. Connector grants intersect the user's current mailbox permissions and granted scopes, and can never increase them. A connector with `drafts:write` cannot issue a send request.

## Working assumptions, not settled facts

Start with one company, about 10 staff and nine addresses across one or two domains. Actual inbox/alias mapping and receiving routes remain unknown. Use online-first clients and the smallest useful service set. The old figure of 18 addresses is superseded. No actual company domain, provider account, budget, message volume, storage growth, data residency, legal retention, SSO vendor or continuity target is assumed known.

Before deployment, resolve the actual addresses and existing MX provider, new-address versus migration scope, ordinary correspondence versus marketing, peak inbound/outbound volume and attachment sizes, region, backup retention and who owns server maintenance. These questions do not block designing or reviewing the system. They do block safe DNS migration and final capacity/SLA commitments.

## Design artifacts

The architecture contains C4-style context/container views and trust boundaries. The database tutorial contains the conceptual ER model and constraints. Contracts document route shapes, transaction boundaries and state transitions. [The local agent prompt](LOCAL_BUILD_PROMPT.md) and [completion plan](docs/local-completion-plan.md) now define the bounded execution path before credentials; the release plan describes later live gates. These documents are not evidence of implemented features. The [expanded planning index](.planning/README.md) now governs research, exact agent routing, language ownership, later mobile targets and no-live-send activation. Application credentials stay last; implementation-agent authentication is a separate prerequisite.
