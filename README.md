# Elevateo Mail

Shared company mailroom with one Rails domain authority and a React/TypeScript client.

## Current state

Application IN PROGRESS: R17 selectively integrates accepted Mira conflict-navigation and Elara native-diagnostic harness repairs over immutable 5c5cc397. Only three test source paths change; production, contracts, observer boundary and Docker recipes remain identical. New candidate runtime NOT_RUN; observer OFF, BE02 unaccepted, BE03 closed.

Sealed R14 on 5c5: Python25/25 PASS; frontend lint/typecheck and 31files/629tests PASS; diagnostics12 =8PASS/4FAIL/0skip, compile PASS; GUI NOT_RUN, zero screenshots. Both wrapper-failure attempts remain preserved. Jules independently audited174 referenced artifacts,3790 source entries and307 backend-reuse dependencies with zero mismatch; all six cleanup/independent-absence checks PASS. R15 Node24.21 plain/node--test probes establish controlled stack-hook suppression feasibility only (hostile counters all zero); authored repairs remain unexecuted. Delayed-logout cancellation and the original R12 1093ms failure cause remain unknown.

R12 retains12cases/9PASS/3FAIL and21 sanitized PNG; R13 backend13runs/346assertions/0fail/error/skip did not rerun full backend suites. R9 c8 backend390/5792 and frontend624/all eight gates PASS retain original provenance. F2 durable recovery remains OPEN: accepted reload loses newer memory-only buffer/operation; committed server version survives.

See [R17 handoff](docs/completion/int401-r17-handoff.md), [history](docs/completion/int401-status-history-20261014.md) and [milestones](docs/completion/int401-remaining-milestones.md). Root owns acceptance and vault writes; Cassian integrates/mirrors; Soren alone schedules Docker. Authority task_e3a9f4f3a9f2 / ctx_8112d6909aa2.

## Start the local build

Start with [the planning index](.planning/README.md), then give the implementation agent [LOCAL_BUILD_PROMPT.md](LOCAL_BUILD_PROMPT.md). It directs the agent to inspect and reuse the existing local frontend material, then complete [the end-to-end local plan](docs/local-completion-plan.md) with real local Supabase services and simulated mail transport. Required agent authentication precedes named consultations and Devin work; application provider, host, DNS, AI and signing credentials stay at final activation. The earlier authentication failures were resolved; the initial and BE-01 exact-model opinions have completed. [Ready-to-use consultation prompts and launch instructions](.planning/consultations/README.md) are saved for the next AI agent. The prompt retains setup requirements; current implementation evidence is summarized above.

## Recommended design

- **Resend** transports permitted outbound mail and delivers incoming-mail events. Elevateo owns the mailbox experience and durable history.
- **Self-hosted Supabase** supplies PostgreSQL, Auth and private attachment Storage. It is not an IMAP/SMTP mail server.
- **Accepted local direction (ADR 0002):** React/strict TypeScript and one Ruby on Rails domain application running as API and worker. Use PostgreSQL for the durable job ledger; no second queue authority is selected.
- **Accepted local direction:** Rust/Tauri Mac and C#/.NET Windows hosts; requested Java Android APK and SwiftUI iOS clients follow. Separate platform artifacts use one backend. PHP, Go and Python have bounded SDK, diagnostic and fixture roles; other requested languages have explicit conditional roles.
- **Accepted local direction:** an Elevateo MCP connector exposes authorized search/read/draft tools to Codex and Claude. Sending stays in the human-controlled application initially. Separate in-app Codex and Claude/Fable adapters use supported local runtimes, scoped tools and explicit authentication eligibility.
- **Proposed:** start on a VPS with Docker Compose, TLS reverse proxy and off-host backups. Railway remains an alternative if operational convenience outweighs infrastructure cost/control.

Use [ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-local-architecture.md) to interpret the expanded architecture, preserving suitable first-party work. Each bounded implementation task retains its own consultation and review gates. They are not already implemented dependencies or blanket production approvals. Hosting remains a later decision. Resend now also documents a private-beta Inboxes API; it is not a launch dependency. See [delivery and hosting](docs/mail-delivery-and-hosting.md).

## Source collection and goals

- [Codex-first market/reuse scan: 25 repositories and eight Reddit threads](.planning/research/reuse-market-scan.md) â€” comparative discovery, with new pins/deep audits pending
- [Devin, Astra MAX/LOW and independent Claude-agent workflow](.planning/AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md)
- [Language, platform and in-app CLI connector plan](.planning/CLIENTS_AND_CLI_CONNECTORS.md)
- [Nine-address inventory, Resend CLI and disabled Instantly warmup](.planning/MAIL_ACCOUNTS_AND_ACTIVATION.md)

- [What the finished Elevateo Mail looks like](docs/end-goal.md)
- [All six source snapshots, exact revisions and integrity checks](third_party/README.md)
- [Six independent repository dossiers](docs/reference-repositories/README.md)
- [Best-component adoption matrix](docs/component-adoption.md)
- [Our goals and acceptance evidence](docs/goals-and-traceability.md)
- [Third-party licenses and notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)

The source collection preserves all 2,765 tracked paths in its manifests. One published sample TLS private-key file is deliberately omitted; all other 2,764 files retain exact upstream bytes. Reference inclusion does not approve runtime adoption.

## Setup and testing

Integrated application source is present. Use the maintained `scripts/dev` command surface and root `compose.yaml`; follow [the local completion plan](docs/local-completion-plan.md). Soren alone runs application builds and tests in fleet Docker during this wave. Do not execute archived upstream setup instructions. Source availability does not establish runtime acceptance.

Application lint, typecheck, unit/integration tests must run in Docker; browser validation and platform-specific packaging checks follow before release. Documentation checks for this update are recorded in `code-reviews.md`. No live email, domain change, infrastructure purchase or deployment occurred.

Verify source intake with `python3 scripts/verify_upstream.py`; run isolated provenance-tool tests with `python3 -B scripts/test_snapshot_tools.py -v`. These are repository tooling checks, not application acceptance tests.
